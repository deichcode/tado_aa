# tado_aa (Tado Auto-Assist for Geofencing and Open Window Detection)

A python script that automatically adjusts the temperature in your home upon leaving or arriving based on your settings from the tado app. It also automatically switches off the heating (activating Open Window Mode) in the room where the tado TRV detects an open window.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- PyTado: This script relies on PyTado. Install it using:
  `pip3 install python-tado`

This script was made possible because of PyTado's author, Chris Jewell (chrism0dwk@gmail.com), and the person who modified it, Wolfgang Malgadey (wolfgang@malgadey.de).
